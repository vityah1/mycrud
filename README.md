# mycrud
Very simple CRUD flask app with SQLLite database and some tests on pyTest

For start app you need install all requirements.txt [pip install Flask]
For start tests you need install pytest [pip install pytest]

1. execute crt_db.py for create database
2. execute app.py for start flask app server
3. execute py.test for do tests


This is not BEST PRACTICE. This is very simple, quick builded crud app for input test. Dont repeat this example on product :)
